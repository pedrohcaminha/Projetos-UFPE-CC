# Blank p5.js project

This is a blank p5.js project for your convenience. This can be a starting point for you. It effectively equivalent to opening a blank project in the p5.js editor and saving it.

The occasion for this blank project is for you to turn in your first set of dailies, which weren't created using a real git workflow. Here's how to turn them in:

* Fork this repo.
* Create a new branch; give it a legible name.
* Copy and paste your code into the files in the branch. (Use Atom for this.)
* Commit your changes.
* Submit a pull request, giving it a legible name.

Submitting a pull request from a forked project is how you turn work in on a particular daily assignment. We will cover this in lab on 1/21.
